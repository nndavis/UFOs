# UFOs
 
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to filter through UFO sightings on multiple criteria: the criteria being; date, city, state, country, and shape. 
Previously, this site was only filterable by date. It also used a button to initiate the search. Now it will go through all criteria after pressing enter. This will be done with javascript and html.

## Results
To begin, here is a picture of the data with no filters added.

It is a fairly easy process to navigate through the data by using the new filter system. A user is able to filter by one criteria or by multiple at the same time. To start, I filtered by date by following a format provided. Then once the date is typed a user must press enter or click off.

It is the first filter listed, so naturally a user may think that the first filter needs hold a value. That is not the case though, here a user can use any of the filters in any order. I will showcase this by filtering by country.

In addition to no particular order needed, a user is able to use multiple filters at once. Here is the data filtered by date and state.

Reasonably, the filter system is easy to use by providing default formats as well as not requiring an order or a set amount of filters used.

## Summary
The website is formatted nicely, and has a solid filter system to navigate through the UFO sighting data. Although it is nice, it is not perfect. One drawback of this site is that it lacks pictures. A text description of the sighting is great especially with so much criteria, but generally people want to see a photo of the sighting. That way a person can use their own eyes to decide whether or not it is in fact a UFO. 
### Recommendation
To begin, I would recommend that there is an option to be adding pictures to the data. Besides that, I believe added additional filters would prove useful. There is still the duration and comments criteria. It would add more accessibility to the site, and would be fairly easy to implement. Additionally, a button to clear out the filters would be great. Deleting the data entered to refresh the data to its original state is not efficient. A clear/reset button would be used often enough to add.
